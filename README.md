# JH.Ops.JHung.OutlookVBA.MailbuddyContactManager
Contact manager module for MS Outlook
Tag based contact manager used to crowdsource the creation of internal contact lists.

Intended to reduce the amount of time it takes to put together an internal mailing list,
reduce the amount of time users spend cultivating their internal contact lists, as well as
immortalize useful contact lists past the lifetimes of their creators/owners.

Users should be able to assign/remove tags for themselves, e.g. #UW #NY #15THFLOOR,
and the script will pull up a full list of contacts which match tags provided, referenced
among all the tags. Admins will be able to assign/remove tags for anyone.
